                <h3>What is Doto <red>2</red> ?</h3>
                <p>Doto 2 is an improved model from Doto where it is a multiplayer online battle game. Doto simply is the Dystopia of The Ouroboros, where two elder dragons, the fierce blue dragon and the mighty red dragon fight for their territory and it inherits until their succesors. The goal of the game is simple. As one of the succesors from one of the dragon, you and your team just need to reach the enemyâ€™s base and destroy it while defending your own base.</p><br>
                <p>The blue dragon succesors, the Radiant. The Radiant is a faction in Doto 2 that revolves around light, heat and life. Most of the heroes from the faction are seen as protectors and champions of good.</p><br>
                <p>The red dragon succesors, the Dire. The Dire is a faction in  Doto 2. Its hero base revolves around Darkness and Evil, as opposed to the Radiant's Light and Justice. Most of the heroes from the Dire have backgrounds that imply or show their darker sides</p><br>
                <p>You and your team will be made through matchmaking, randomly selected as you will need to defend your base from creeps, killing enemy creeps, getting gold, become stronger, slay enemies, and win the war of Ouroboros.</p>
                <br><br><br><br><br>

                <h3>Doto <red>2</red> Heroes</h3>

                <p>Doto 2 heroes are separated by their attributes or roles.</p><br>

                <p>Here are some main Attributes:</p>
                <p>1. Strength, is a measure of a hero's toughness and endurance. Each point increases maximum health by 15 and health regeneration by 1.</p>
                <p>2. Agility, is a measure of a hero's swiftness and dexterit. Each point increases armor by 0.17 and attack speed by 5.</p>
                <p>3. Intelligence, is a measure of a hero's wit and wisdom. Each point increases maximum mana by 20 and mana regeneration by 0.5.</p>
                <br>

                <p>As for roles:
                <p>1. Carry, mostly farms and get equipments</p>
                <p>2. Core, win the mid lane game and help other lanes by ganking</p>
                <p>3. Offlaner, mostly the one who receive all the damage or initiate the war</p>
                <p>4. Support, help the other with boosting equipments or skills and roaming</p>
                <p>5. Hard support, provided support item and vision (wards and others).</p>
                <br><br><br><br><br>

                <h3>Basic Mechanics</h3><br>
                <h4>Drafting</h4>
                <p>After matchmaking, you and your team will be given time in drafting phase to select your heroes. Please make your tactics in this game and choose a perfect hero to counter the other enemy hero. Remember that every hero has the counter for each of themselves.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4>Items</h4>
                <p>After drafting, you will be given time to arrange your item. In this phase, you will buy your starting items. Please use your early item wisely as it will be important in the next phase.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4>Early Game</h4>
                <p>After the game has started, there will be 1 minutes until the creeps spawn. The objective in here is either get your bounty on your territory or steal enemy's bounty on their territory but remember that, if the enemy outnumber you, you can get yourself killed. After 1 minute, the creeps will spawn and start the laning phase.</p>
                <p>As here are the laning phase:</p><br>
                <p>- Core go to the middle lane</p>
                <p>- Carry and hard support go to the safe lane</p>
                <p>- Offlaner and support go to the off lane</p><br>
                <p>Remember that you can't directly buy items as the shops in the fountain or in the jungle, you either need to go the shops or the courier will send them to you. Note that early game is a phase that really decides your mid game as in mid game, the team that has a lot of advantages will have a lot of chances to win the game. Also, dont forget to destroy towers.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4>Mid Game</h4>
                <p>As all heroes already get their basic items except for other support role, you will need to start push and end the game if you have the advantages or if you are in losing position, you need to hold the enemy and keep farming in the jungle.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4>Late Game</h4>
                <p>In late game, networth and xp will be useless as all of the heroes have already get their full equipment. In this phase, the only one who get a really good strategy and good war control will win the game.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4>Teamwork and strategy</h4>
                <p>Above all of that, remember that Doto 2 is a game of teamwork and strategy. It will be hard for you to win and carry the game by yourself. Remember not to toxic your enemies or teammates as we need to play a good game. Teamwork is the key to win the game, without it the chances of your team lost will be much higher.</p>
